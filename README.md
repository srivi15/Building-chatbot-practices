# Building-chatbot-practices
This is the repository that contains practice programs I learn to build a chatbot.

In this, the programs are from scratch. Firstly, there are programs where you assign response statically. Then, we move forward to assigning dynamic responses, then to use regex, rasa nlu and finally, the power of statefulness.

# Note:
This is a repository which can be used for revision purposes when you have any doubts while working with chatbots.

!! Do not copy or clone the repository.
